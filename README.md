# GameTests
A repo to store some of my small game projects for testing and learning purposes

You can run the Slither.io blend file using UPBGE. This projected was tested on UPBGE 0.30.0

This was made with Seyit Ali YAPRAKCI's tutorial for the purpose of improving my Blender Python skills. Source = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch4eqr0cvrQ
